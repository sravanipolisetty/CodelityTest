# CodelityTest
Algorithm Challenge

you are given an implementation of a function :

    class Solution {public int solution(int M,int[] A)}
An integer M and a non-empty zero-indexed array A consisting of N non-negative integers, which are not greater than M, returns the value that occurs
 most often in the array
 
 For example, given M=3 and array such that

    A[0] = 3
    A[1] = 0
    A[2] = 1
    A[3] = 1
    A[4] = 2
    A[5] = 3
The function may return 1 or 3

The goal is to calculate the number of distinct slices.

Write a function:
1. To find the Max Occurence of a number from an array
2. To find the minimum difference of unique numbers of an array
3. To return the index of Linkedlist

Assume that:

N is an integer within the range [1..100,000];
M is an integer within the range [0..100,000];
each element of array A is an integer within the range [0..M].
Complexity:

expected worst-case time complexity is O(N);
expected worst-case space complexity is O(M), beyond input storage (not counting the storage required for input arguments).
Elements of input arrays can be modified.
